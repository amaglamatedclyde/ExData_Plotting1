## Exploratory Data Analysis 
### Class Project 1

This assignment uses data from measurements of electric power consumption in
one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost
4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values
are available.


* I've constructed 480x480 pixel plots and saved them to files named
plot1.png, plot2.png, plot3.png.

* Separate R code files (`plot1.R`, `plot2.R`, etc.) construct the corresponding plots.

* The code files include code for reading the data and the code that creates the PNG files 
so the plots can be fully reproduced.
